# Flowchart Simulator - C++

## Overview

Developed a sophisticated flowchart simulator as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course project. This tool empowers users to visually construct intricate logical sequences by intuitively dragging and dropping elements and connecting them. The project involved collaborative efforts in designing and implementing a robust graphical user interface (GUI) using advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Contributions included refining algorithms for flowchart validation and generating equivalent C++ code, ensuring the simulator's functionality and accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Visual Flowchart Construction:** Drag-and-drop interface for seamless creation of complex logical diagrams.
- **Intuitive GUI:** Designed with user-friendly interactions to enhance usability and navigation.
- **Code Generation:** Automated conversion of constructed flowcharts into executable C++ code.
- **Validation Logic:** Built-in checks to ensure logical integrity and syntactical correctness.

## Achievements

Successfully delivered a highly functional tool that received acclaim for its precision and user-friendly design. This project not only enhanced proficiency in C++ programming and OOP principles but also provided invaluable experience in software engineering methodologies and collaborative problem-solving.

**Skills Developed:** C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Algorithm Design, Software Engineering
